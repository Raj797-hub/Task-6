üîê Common Password Attacks ‚Äì Research Summary
1. Brute Force Attack
A brute-force attack tries all possible combinations of characters until it finds the correct password.

How it works: The attacker uses software to systematically guess passwords by trying every possible combination.

Defensive Strategy: Use long, complex passwords with special characters, and enable account lockout policies or rate limiting.

2. Dictionary Attack
A dictionary attack uses a list of commonly used passwords and words to guess credentials.

How it works: The attacker tries passwords from a predefined list (e.g., password123, qwerty, admin, etc.).

Defensive Strategy: Avoid common words, phrases, or predictable patterns in your passwords.

3. Credential Stuffing
This attack uses stolen username-password pairs from previous breaches to log in to other accounts.

How it works: Attackers use automated tools to try breached credentials across multiple platforms.

Defensive Strategy: Use unique passwords for each account and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).

4. Phishing Attacks
Trick users into revealing passwords through fake websites or emails.

How it works: Users are lured into entering credentials into a malicious website that looks legitimate.

Defensive Strategy: Always check URLs, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and use phishing-resistant MFA methods.

5. Keylogging
Captures everything typed on a device, including passwords.

How it works: Malicious software records keystrokes and sends them to the attacker.

Defensive Strategy: Use antivirus software, keep systems updated, and avoid installing unknown programs.
