*Cybersecurity Internship Task 6* - Analyze password security through strength testing and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 *Objective*

Create various password combinations and test their strength using online tools to understand password security fundamentals.

---

## 🛠 *Tools Used*

- *howsecureismypassword.net* - Crack time estimation
- *passwordmeter.com* - Comprehensive strength scoring
- *security.org password checker* - Additional validation

---

## 📋 *Password Test Results*

| Password Category | Sample Format | Score | Crack Time | Security Level |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| *Simple* | 123456789 | 18/100 | Instantly | ❌ Terrible |
| *Basic* | MyPassword1 | 45/100 | 2 hours | ⚠ Weak |
| *Improved* | MyP@ssword123 | 70/100 | 2 months | 🟡 Good |
| *Complex* | Str0ng&P@ss2024 | 92/100 | 41 million years | ✅ Excellent |

---

## 📊 *Analysis Results*

### *Strength Factors Identified*
- *Character Length*: 14+ characters provide best protection
- *Mixed Characters*: Upper/lower case + numbers + symbols
- *Avoiding Patterns*: No keyboard sequences or common substitutions
- *Dictionary Resistance*: Random combinations beat common words

### *Vulnerability Patterns*
- Personal information easily guessed
- Common substitutions (@ for a, 0 for o) don't add much security
- Sequential characters (abc, 123) make passwords weak
- Length trumps complexity in most cases

## 🔍 *Security Insights*

### *Attack Methods Studied*
- *Brute Force*: Systematic password guessing
- *Dictionary Attack*: Using common password lists
- *Hybrid Attack*: Combining dictionary + modifications

### *Protection Strategies*
1. *Use random character combinations*
2. *Implement minimum 12-character length*
3. *Include all character types*
4. *Avoid predictable patterns*
5. *Use different passwords for each account*

## 🛡 *Best Practices Discovered*

### *Strong Password Recipe*

[Unusual Word] + [Random Numbers] + [Special Characters] + [Case Mixing]
Result: "Quantum#847$Secure"


### *Additional Security Measures*
- *Password Managers*: Generate and store complex passwords
- *Two-Factor Authentication*: Extra security layer
- *Regular Updates*: Change passwords every 90 days

---
